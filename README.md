# TicTacToe
Tic-Tac-Toe playable in a terminal.

Should run pretty much everywhere where there is a terminal and a numpad available.
(Number row is supported as alternate input.)

~~Requires .NET 6.~~
(v1.2.0 onward application is self contained. Separate installation not neccessary.)

On Windows there is integration with the logitech lighting api.
